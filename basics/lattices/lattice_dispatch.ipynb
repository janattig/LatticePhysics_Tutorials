    "# Dispatch for `AbstractLattice` objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a lot of information about lattice objects is already encoded into their type signature, this signature can be used in dispatch to greatly reduce the number of `if` statements as well as greatly improve the performance of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial aims at providing an overview how to use dispatch for `AbstractLattice` objects as well as giving some examples. It is very much advised to first work through the tutorials for [dispatching on site types ](https://github.com/janattig/LatticePhysics_Tutorials/blob/master/basics/sites_bonds/site_dispatch.ipynb) and [dispatching on bond types](https://github.com/janattig/LatticePhysics_Tutorials/blob/master/basics/sites_bonds/bond_dispatch.ipynb) as well as [dispatching on unitcell types](https://github.com/janattig/LatticePhysics_Tutorials/blob/master/basics/unitcells/unitcell_dispatch.ipynb). Also, fundamental knowledge about how lattices work should be present.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the required tutorials explain dispatch in greater detail, this tutorial will mainly focus on examples. Also note, that for the sake of simple examples, this tutorial will use pre-implemented unitcells from `LatPhysUnitcellLibrary` as well as lattices built with `LatPhysLatticeConstruction`."

    "### Example 1 - Plotting\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose, we want to write a plotting backend for plotting lattices in the plotting package of our choice. In this case we might consider writing a unified syntax for all sorts of lattices, i.e. one could define a `plotLattice` function instead of two `plotLattice2D` and `plotLattice3D` functions. Also, dispatch has to be used to make sure that only the lattices in the correct spatial dimension are passed into the respective function.\n",

    "    \n",

    "\n",
