    "For most lattice based calculations, a `Lattice` object is needed that has to be constructed at some point to deliver the lattice connectivity information. Usually, the preceiding step is to obtain the lattice geometry in form of a `Unitcell` object, which is usually obtained from a pre-implemented unitcell. Details on how to obtain the unitcell can be found in [this tutorial](https://github.com/janattig/LatticePhysics_Tutorials/blob/master/basics/unitcells/pre-implemented_unitcells.ipynb).\n",
