    "The most defining feature of a lattice is the periodic arrangement of **sites**, connected by **bonds**. However, not every site can be mapped onto every other by translation of Bravais lattices, but one can define groups of sites, that can be mapped onto each other, so called **unitcells** of the lattice. Similar to site and bond, unitcells therefore have their own type in `LatticePhysics.jl`, equipped with an abstract supertype as well as a shared interface.\n",
